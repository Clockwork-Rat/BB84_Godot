    "2" : "This is a polarizer. This is where the real information is added.",
    "3" : "The color is the direction that the polarizer is oriented. If the polarizer is straight up and down, or side to side, it is one color, and if the polarizer is oriented diagonally, it is the other.",

    "5" : "Let's say that a \"blue one\" is when the polarizer is straight up and down, like this: ",
    "6" : "The light is now moving straight up and down, and when that beam reaches a \"green\" receiving polarizer, it has a 50/50 chance of entering",
